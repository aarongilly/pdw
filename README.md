# Personal Data Warehouse

## Project Meta

This is made with Vite: ![test image input](/vite.svg)

This is the README.md - it also generates the top-level documentation page.

The goal here is to have something that you could publish to NPM.

Also to develop (some) **LOCAL FIRST** storage connector(s)

# Connector Dev

Try to remain connector agnostic! Also to have the API work in-browser and in Node.
(can you use the Temporal polyfill in node?)

Anyway, `npm run dev` for Docs & browser-based stuff

- [ ] TODO - make a LOCAL tester script and add it to package.json to test SQL
